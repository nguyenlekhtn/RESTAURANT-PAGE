# restaurant-page
This is a project I made when learning on theodinproect https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/restaurant-page

What skill I used in this project:
    - using JavaScript alone to generate the entire contents of the website
    - using webpack for bundling my website
    - using tabbed browsing to access pages
